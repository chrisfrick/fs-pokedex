In a Java project, linting could be handled with Checkstyle, Spotbugs, or Sonarlint. Testing could be handled with Selenium, JUnit, JBehave, or TestNG. Building could be handled with Gradle or Maven.

Alternatives to Github Actions and Jenkins include GitLab CI, CircleCI, Buddy, and Codeship, among many others.

Jenkins is popular for Java developers, but its flexibility makes it sometimes difficult to set up. For this reason, a single small or medium sized application might be better with a cloud-based CI environment. The cost is likely lower, and for most "normal" use cases, configuration is likely simpler. For a larger organization with more complicated CI requirements or with multiple large apps, running on self-hosted hardware might be a better option. Especially in cases with specific hardware requirements, like the need for a GPU to run tests, running on a self-hosted server is likely the more economical and preferred CI solution.

In this case with a small team of six devs actively developing the application, a cloud-based CI environment would likely make the most sense. It would be faster and simpler to setup than a self-hosted i.e. Jenkins environment, and could allow the app to reach production quickly and reliably with minimal configuration troubles.
